                      <a href="https://rthm.com/" target="_blank">RTHM</a> leads the way in pioneering research,
                      diagnostics, and remote care for individuals with Long
                      COVID, ME/CFS, and other co-occurring conditions.<br />

                      Recognizing the scarcity of qualified providers and the escalating expenses tied to treating these
                      conditions, <a href="https://rthm.com/" target="_blank">RTHM</a> made the decision to establish a
                      digital ecosystem that would bring together the
                      endeavors of patients, providers, and researchers.<br />

                      <a href="https://rthm.com/" target="_blank">RTHM</a> had an ambitious vision for an ecosystem that
                      combines engaging patient and physician digital
                      experiences while pushing forward treatment of ME/CFS and Long COVID.<br />

                      At the minimum, the ecosystem would include:<br />

                      The mobile app would allow patients to monitor their conditions, track symptoms, and follow
                      treatment plans, while physicians would diagnose and recommend treatment based on patients' PHI in
                      the dashboard.

                    <h4>What Did We Build?</h4>

                    <a href="https://rthm.com/" target="_blank">RTHM</a> had an ambitious vision for an ecosystem that
                    combines engaging patient and physician digital
                    experiences while pushing forward treatment of ME/CFS and Long COVID.<br /><br />

                    At the minimum, the ecosystem would include:<br />

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- mobile app for patients<br />

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- admin area for RTHM<br />

                    The mobile app would allow patients to monitor their conditions, track symptoms, and follow
                    treatment plans, while physicians would diagnose and recommend treatment based on patients' PHI in

                    <h5>-----Getting <strong>M</strong> in MVP right-----</h5>
                    <p>
                      The worst thing you can do with a project of this scale is to rush it, trying to do everything at
                      once.<br />Fortunately, the founders recognized the iterative nature of Agile and embraced the
                      no-code/low-code approach.<br />New research continues to emerge on long COVID on a daily basis,
                      so
                      everyone had to be comfortable pivoting frequently.
                    </p>

                    To help <a href="https://rthm.com/" target="_blank">RTHM</a> create a minimum viable product, we
                    focused on:<br />

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Researching tech feasibility of ready-made solutions, such as Apple's
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ResearchKit and CareKit, or ResearchStack for Android<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Exploring compatibility of multiple EHRs, frameworks and 3rd party
                    services<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Rapid prototyping of patient and provider user experiences<br /><br />

                    As a result, we supported the design of a scalable and secure architecture that would help the
                    ecosystem mature without running into typical growth hiccups. The best part? With the no-code
                    tools, we managed to ship the MVP much faster.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <h5>-----Taking Care of <strong>V</strong> in MVP-----</h5>

                    <p>
                      To make the product viable (read valuable) for customers, our team zeroed in on its engagement
                      capacity:<br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Intuitive and welcoming design<br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Interactive charts<br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Automated reminders via SMS<br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tips and instructions for patients<br />
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Digitizing medical treatment protocols<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This helped establish the software as a trusted ally for patients and physicians in their daily
                      lives, leading to improved collection of actionable health data.
                    </p>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <h4>-----Wearables Are More Than Trend-----</h4>

                    Accurately diagnosing and treating ME/CFS and Long COVID implies meticulous analysis of a myriad
                    of health data points.<br />

                    To make this PHI available to physicians and for automated data analysis, we explored integrating
                    with 3rd party services which in turn normalized health data across multiple health and fitness
                    ecosystems such as Apple Health and Google Fit.<br />

                    All data travels within the ecosystem, following strict HIPAA compliance guidelines.<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <h5>-----It Takes Two to Tango-----</h5>
                    While RTHM worked on a no-code back-end platform for physicians, Topflight integrated it with a
                    custom-built mobile patient application. Data models and flows were in continual transition,
                    making our agile development approach crucial for the two teams to interact seamlessly.<br />

                    The ecosystem was built out one step at a time by successfully coordinating both teams’
                    complementary skill sets into a great joint delivery.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <h4>-----Result-----</h4>
                    <p>
                      “Topflight was talented at taking apart complex functionality.<br />They have talented designers
                      and
                      excellent developers.<br />We were happy with their designs, and they successfully got us off the
                      ground with the product's first version.”
